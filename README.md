Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module. The game features two paddles and a ball, and the objective is to hit the ball with the paddle and score points. The first player to reach 10 points wins.
Getting Started

To run the game, simply run the main.py file in your Python interpreter. You may need to install the turtle module first.
How to Play

    Player 1 uses the W and S keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.
    Player 2 uses the up and down arrow keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.
    The ball bounces off the walls and the paddles, and the speed increases each time it hits a paddle.
    If the ball goes past a player's paddle, the other player scores a point.
    The game ends when a player reaches 10 points.
